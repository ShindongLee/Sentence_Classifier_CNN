even in the summertime , the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities .

there's an excellent 90-minute film here ; unfortunately , it runs for 170 . 
it throws quirky characters , odd situations , and off-kilter dialogue at us , all as if to say , " look at this ! this is an interesting movie ! " but the film itself is ultimately quite unengaging .

too silly to take seriously . 
a fifty car pileup of cliches . 
as an actor's showcase , hart's war has much to recommend it , even if the top-billed willis is not the most impressive player . as a story of dramatic enlightenment , the screenplay by billy ray and terry george leaves something to be desired . 
the drama was so uninspiring that even a story immersed in love , lust , and sin couldn't keep my attention . 
bad company has one of the most moronic screenplays of the year , full of holes that will be obvious even to those who aren't looking for them .

a bold ( and lovely ) experiment that will almost certainly bore most audiences into their own brightly colored dreams . 
while solondz tries and tries hard , storytelling fails to provide much more insight than the inside column of a torn book jacket .

despite auteuil's performance , it's a rather listless amble down the middle of the road , where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug . 
there is something in full frontal , i guess , about artifice and acting and how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them , but like most movie riddles , it works only if you have an interest in the characters you see . 
bartlett's hero remains a reactive cipher , when opening the man's head and heart is the only imaginable reason for the film to be made .

impostor can't think of a thing to do with these characters except have them run through dark tunnels , fight off various anonymous attackers , and evade elaborate surveillance technologies . 
shallow , noisy and pretentious . 
self-congratulatory , misguided , and ill-informed , if nonetheless compulsively watchable . 
the nicest thing that can be said about stealing harvard ( which might have been called freddy gets molested by a dog ) is that it's not as obnoxious as tom green's freddie got fingered . 
a blair witch- style adventure that plays like a bad soap opera , with passable performances from everyone in the cast . 
an ill-conceived jumble that's not scary , not smart and not engaging . 
utter mush . . . conceited pap . 
like coming into a long-running , well-written television series where you've missed the first half-dozen episodes and probably won't see the next six . 
stiff and schmaltzy and clumsily directed . 
one problem with the movie , directed by joel schumacher , is that it jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time . 
super troopers is an odd amalgam of comedy genres , existing somewhere between the often literal riffs of early zucker brothers/abrahams films , and the decidedly foul stylings of their post-modern contemporaries , the farrelly brothers . 
as a kind of colorful , dramatized pbs program , frida gets the job done . but , for that , why not watch a documentary ? 
with minimal imagination , you could restage the whole thing in your bathtub . 
believability wasn't one of the film's virtues . 
hollywood ending is the most disappointing woody allen movie ever . he has a great cast and a great idea . but the execution is a flop with the exception of about six gags that really work . 
your appreciation of it will depend on what experiences you bring to it and what associations you choose to make . 
spain's greatest star wattage doesn't overcome the tumult of maudlin tragedy . 
they ought to be a whole lot scarier than they are in this tepid genre offering . 
a pale xerox of other , better crime movies . 
a perfect example of rancid , well-intentioned , but shamelessly manipulative movie making .

if oscar had a category called best bad film you thought was going to be really awful but wasn't , guys would probably be duking it out with the queen of the damned for the honor . 
fessenden has nurtured his metaphors at the expense of his narrative , but he does display an original talent . 
christina ricci comedy about sympathy , hypocrisy and love is a misfire . 
slick piece of cross-promotion . 
it's another video movie photographed like a film , with the bad lighting that's often written off as indie film naturalism . 
the techno tux is good for a few laughs , as are chan and hewitt , but when such a good design turns out to be a cheap knockoff , we can't recommend anything but a rental for the tuxedo . 
the piquant story needs more dramatic meat on its bones . 
it's dumb , but more importantly , it's just not scary . 
i can't recommend it . but it's surprisingly harmless . 
it's of the quality of a lesser harrison ford movie - six days , seven nights , maybe , or that dreadful sabrina remake . 
the experience of going to a film festival is a rewarding one ; the experiencing of sampling one through this movie is not . 
too much of it feels unfocused and underdeveloped . 
i thought my own watch had stopped keeping time as i slogged my way through clockstoppers . 
has a long and clunky ending . . . which forces the audience to fidget through ten pseudo-serious minutes while waiting for the ending credits and the deleted scenes montage to break the audience's awkward silence
uncommonly stylish but equally silly . . . the picture fails to generate much suspense , nor does it ask searching enough questions to justify its pretensions . 
the plot convolutions ultimately add up to nothing more than jerking the audience's chain . 
this is nothing but familiar territory . 
from the opening scenes , it's clear that all about the benjamins is a totally formulaic movie . 
do not see this film . 
i'd have to say the star and director are the big problems here . 
 . . . nothing scary here except for some awful acting and lame special effects . 
doesn't offer much besides glib soullessness , raunchy language and a series of brutal set pieces . . . that raise the bar on stylized screen violence . 
the stripped-down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality , but the measured pace and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious . 
a string of rehashed sight gags based in insipid vulgarity . 
the script isn't very good ; not even someone as gifted as hoffman ( the actor ) can make it work . 
vera's technical prowess ends up selling his film short ; he smoothes over hard truths even as he uncovers them . 
comes . . . uncomfortably close to coasting in the treads of the bicycle thief . 
this piece of channel 5 grade trash is , quite frankly , an insult to the intelligence of the true genre enthusiast . 
an overemphatic , would-be wacky , ultimately tedious sex farce . 
no aspirations to social import inform the movie version . this is a shameless sham , calculated to cash in on the popularity of its stars . 
tambor and clayburgh make an appealing couple — he's understated and sardonic , she's appealingly manic and energetic . both deserve better . 
the affectionate loopiness that once seemed congenital to demme's perspective has a tough time emerging from between the badly dated cutesy-pie mystery scenario and the newfangled hollywood post-production effects . 
for all its technical virtuosity , the film is so mired in juvenile and near-xenophobic pedagogy that it's enough to make one pine for the day when godard can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking . 
it made me want to wrench my eyes out of my head and toss them at the screen . 
instead of hiding pinocchio from critics , miramax should have hidden it from everyone . 
there ought to be a directing license , so that ed burns can have his revoked . 
green might want to hang onto that ski mask , as robbery may be the only way to pay for his next project . 
 . . . routine , harmless diversion and little else . 
a fitfully amusing romp that , if nothing else , will appeal to fans of malcolm in the middle and its pubescent star , frankie muniz . 
the actors are appealing , but elysian fields is idiotic and absurdly sentimental . 
there's no emotional pulse to solaris . with an emotional sterility to match its outer space setting , soderbergh's spectacular swing for the fence yields only a spectacular whiff . 
with virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on , chelsea walls is a triple-espresso endurance challenge . 
though perry and hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by jay scherick and david ronn , neither the actors nor director reginald hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining . 
the story and the friendship proceeds in such a way that you're watching a soap opera rather than a chronicle of the ups and downs that accompany lifelong friendships . 
although huppert's intensity and focus has a raw exhilaration about it , the piano teacher is anything but fun . 
there's not enough here to justify the almost two hours . 
attempts by this ensemble film to impart a message are so heavy-handed that they instead pummel the audience . 
comes off like a rejected abc afterschool special , freshened up by the dunce of a screenwriting 101 class . . . . designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears , " crossroads " instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns . 
schaeffer has to find some hook on which to hang his persistently useless movies , and it might as well be the resuscitation of the middle-aged character . 
this charmless nonsense ensues amid clanging film references that make jay and silent bob's excellent adventure seem understated . 
consists of a plot and jokes done too often by people far more talented than ali g
laughably , irredeemably awful . 
the editing is chaotic , the photography grainy and badly focused , the writing unintentionally hilarious , the direction unfocused , the performances as wooden . 
it may be a prize winner , but teacher is a bomb . 
i'm not suggesting that you actually see it , unless you're the kind of person who has seen every wim wenders film of the '70s . 
to imagine the life of harry potter as a martial arts adventure told by a lobotomized woody allen is to have some idea of the fate that lies in store for moviegoers lured to the mediocrity that is kung pow : enter the fist . 
the piano teacher is the sort of movie that discourages american audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film . 
if it's another regurgitated action movie you're after , there's no better film than half past dead . 
a sermonizing and lifeless paean to teenage dullards . 
the charms of willful eccentricity , at least as evidenced by this latest cinematic essay , are beginning to wear a bit thin . 
nair stuffs the film with dancing , henna , ornamentation , and group song , but her narrative clichés and telegraphed episodes smell of old soap opera . 
it's getting harder and harder to ignore the fact that hollywood isn't laughing with us , folks . it's laughing at us . 
i hated every minute of it . 
not so much funny as aggressively sitcom-cute , it's full of throwaway one-liners , not-quite jokes , and a determined tv amiability that allen personifies . 
the sad thing about knockaround guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film isn't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is . 
plays less like a coming-of-age romance than an infomercial . 
there are a few laughs and clever sight gags scattered about , but not enough to make this anything more than another big-budget bust . 
the story's so preposterous that i didn't believe it for a second , despite the best efforts of everyone involved . 
it is a comedy that's not very funny and an action movie that is not very thrilling ( and an uneasy alliance , at that ) . 
the story is familiar from its many predecessors ; like them , it eventually culminates in the not-exactly -stunning insight that crime doesn't pay . 
 . . . fifty minutes of tedious adolescent melodramatics followed by thirty-five minutes of inflated nonsense . 
when the first few villians are introduced as " spider " and " snake " you know you're in for a real winner , creativity at its peak . 
it's also clear from the start that the transporter is running purely on adrenaline , and once the initial high wears off , the film's shortcomings start to shine through . 
human nature initially succeeds by allowing itself to go crazy , but ultimately fails by spinning out of control . 
the thriller side of this movie is falling flat , as the stalker doesn't do much stalking , and no cop or lawyer grasps the concept of actually investigating the case . 
it tells more than it shows . 
each story on its own could have been expanded and worked into a compelling single feature , but in its current incarnation , storytelling never quite gets over its rather lopsided conception . 
where last time jokes flowed out of cho's life story , which provided an engrossing dramatic through line , here the comedian hides behind obviously constructed routines . 
perfectly enjoyable , instantly forgettable , nothing to write home about . 
sets up a nice concept for its fiftysomething leading ladies , but fails loudly in execution . 
kidman is really the only thing that's worth watching in birthday girl , a film by the stage-trained jez butterworth ( mojo ) that serves as yet another example of the sad decline of british comedies in the post-full monty world . 
taken individually or collectively , the stories never add up to as much as they promise . 
if you're not a prepubescent girl , you'll be laughing at britney spears' movie-starring debut whenever it doesn't have you impatiently squinting at your watch . 
being author wells' great-grandson , you'd think filmmaker simon wells would have more reverence for the material . but this costly dud is a far cry from either the book or the beloved film . 
accuracy and realism are terrific , but if your film becomes boring , and your dialogue isn't smart , then you need to use more poetic license . 
a boring , formulaic mix of serial killers and stalk'n'slash . 
schmaltzy and unfunny , adam sandler's cartoon about hanukkah is numbingly bad , little nicky bad , 10 worst list bad . 
bullock's complete lack of focus and ability quickly derails the film
the truth is that the truth about charlie gets increasingly tiresome . 
rates an 'e' for effort -- and a 'b' for boring . 
you're too conscious of the effort it takes to be this spontaneous . 
a monster combat thriller as impersonal in its relentlessness as the videogame series that inspired it . 
proof that a thriller can be sleekly shot , expertly cast , paced with crisp professionalism . . . and still be a letdown if its twists and turns hold no more surprise than yesterday's weather report . 
in the second half of the film , frei's control loosens in direct proportion to the amount of screen time he gives nachtwey for self-analysis . 
director barry skolnick and his screenwriters glibly tick off every point of " the longest yard " playbook like a checklist . 
one minute , you think you're watching a serious actioner ; the next , it's as though clips from the pink panther strikes again and/or sailor moon have been spliced in . 
john mctiernan's botched remake may be subtler than norman jewison's 1975 ultraviolent futuristic corporate-sports saga . it's also stupider . 
this idea has lost its originality . . . and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture . 
it would be hard to think of a recent movie that has worked this hard to achieve this little fun . 
dawdles and drags when it should pop ; it doesn't even have the virtue of enough mindless violence to break up the tedium of all its generational bonding . 
a great idea becomes a not-great movie . 
life is a crock -- or something like it . 
even as lame horror flicks go , this is lame . 
sunshine state lacks the kind of dynamic that limbo offers , and in some ways is a rather indulgent piece . 
even legends like alfred hitchcock and john huston occasionally directed trifles . . . so it's no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like zhang yimou behind the camera for a yarn that's ultimately rather inconsequential . 
this movie is about lying , cheating , but loving the friends you betray . 
it smacks of purely commercial motivation , with no great love for the original . 
at the bottom rung of the series' entries . 
what kids will discover is a new collectible . what parents will suspect is that they're watching a 76-minute commercial . 
opens at a funeral , ends on the protagonist's death bed and doesn't get much livelier in the three hours in between . 
too simple for its own good . 
the advantage of a postapocalyptic setting is that it can be made on the cheap . any rock pile will do for a set . reign of fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap . 
reggio's trippy , ambitious downer can also sometimes come across like nothing more than a glorified nike ad . 
ben affleck as jack ryan , tom clancy's intrepid hero ? ridiculous . what's next ? d . j . qualls as indiana jones ? or tom green as han solo ? 
the film is directed by wally wolodarsky from a script by joe jarvis and greg coolidge . these are names to remember , in order to avoid them in the future . 
lanie's professional success means she must be a failure at life , because she's driven by ambition and doesn't know how to have fun . 
i can only imagine one thing worse than kevin spacey trying on an irish accent , and that's sultry linda fiorentino doing the same thing . 
sadly , hewitt's forte is leaning forward while wearing low-cut gowns , not making snappy comebacks . 
a hysterical yet humorless disquisition on the thin line between sucking face and literally sucking face . 
director brian levant , who never strays far from his sitcom roots , skates blithely from one implausible situation to another , pausing only to tie up loose ends with more bows than you'll find on a french poodle . 
suggests puns about ingredients and soup and somebody being off their noodle , but let's just say the ingredients don't quite add up to a meal . 
even if you feel like you've seen this movie a thousand times before , it is kind of enjoyable thanks mainly to belushi's easy-going likableness . 
say this for the soundtrack , it drowns out the lousy dialogue . 
if i spy were funny ( enough ) or exciting ( enough ) then it would be fairly simple to forgive the financial extortion it's trying to reap from the moviegoing public . 
places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting , and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller . 
what the four feathers lacks is genuine sweep or feeling or even a character worth caring about . 
this kind of dark comedy requires a delicate , surgical touch . but director danny devito and screenwriter adam resnick ( remember cabin boy ? ) just pound away . 
liman , of swingers and go , makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long , low-heat chase , interrupted by a middling car chase . 
the problem isn't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball . 
a prison comedy that never really busts out of its comfy little cell . 
the smug , oily demeanor that donovan adopts throughout the stupidly named pipe dream is just repulsive . 
this limp gender-bender-baller from a first-time director and rookie screenwriter steals wholesale from that 1982's tootsie , forgetting only to retain a single laugh . 
just because it really happened to you , honey , doesn't mean that it's interesting to anyone else . 
if this movie belonged to a sorority , it would be called beta alpha delta . 
the premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six-packs and a pitcher of margaritas in , but the film must have been written . . . in the thrall of a vicious hangover . 
the film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 minutes . 
you would be better off investing in the worthy emi recording that serves as the soundtrack , or the home video of the 1992 malfitano-domingo production . 
however clever nelson has been in providing variation within the confines of her structure and staging , the question remains whether this should , indeed , have been presented as a theatrical release . 
the impact of the armenian genocide is diluted by too much stage business in the modern day . 
going to the website may be just as fun ( and scary ) as going to the film . 
too timid to bring a sense of closure to an ugly chapter of the twentieth century . 
the only thing that could possibly make them less interesting than they already are is for them to get full montied into a scrappy , jovial team .

too much power , not enough puff . 
narc is all menace and atmosphere . 
his [nelson's] screenplay needs some serious re-working to show more of the dilemma , rather than have his characters stage shouting matches about it .
