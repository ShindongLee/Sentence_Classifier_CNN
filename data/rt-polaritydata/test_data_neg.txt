even in the summertime , the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities .

there's an excellent 90-minute film here ; unfortunately , it runs for 170 . 
it throws quirky characters , odd situations , and off-kilter dialogue at us , all as if to say , " look at this ! this is an interesting movie ! " but the film itself is ultimately quite unengaging .

too silly to take seriously . 
a fifty car pileup of cliches . 
as an actor's showcase , hart's war has much to recommend it , even if the top-billed willis is not the most impressive player . as a story of dramatic enlightenment , the screenplay by billy ray and terry george leaves something to be desired . 
the drama was so uninspiring that even a story immersed in love , lust , and sin couldn't keep my attention . 
bad company has one of the most moronic screenplays of the year , full of holes that will be obvious even to those who aren't looking for them .

a bold ( and lovely ) experiment that will almost certainly bore most audiences into their own brightly colored dreams . 
while solondz tries and tries hard , storytelling fails to provide much more insight than the inside column of a torn book jacket .

there is something in full frontal , i guess , about artifice and acting and how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them , but like most movie riddles , it works only if you have an interest in the characters you see . 
bartlett's hero remains a reactive cipher , when opening the man's head and heart is the only imaginable reason for the film to be made .

impostor can't think of a thing to do with these characters except have them run through dark tunnels , fight off various anonymous attackers , and evade elaborate surveillance technologies . 
shallow , noisy and pretentious . 
self-congratulatory , misguided , and ill-informed , if nonetheless compulsively watchable . 
the nicest thing that can be said about stealing harvard ( which might have been called freddy gets molested by a dog ) is that it's not as obnoxious as tom green's freddie got fingered . 
a blair witch- style adventure that plays like a bad soap opera , with passable performances from everyone in the cast . 
an ill-conceived jumble that's not scary , not smart and not engaging . 
utter mush . . . conceited pap . 
like coming into a long-running , well-written television series where you've missed the first half-dozen episodes and probably won't see the next six . 
stiff and schmaltzy and clumsily directed . 
one problem with the movie , directed by joel schumacher , is that it jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time . 
super troopers is an odd amalgam of comedy genres , existing somewhere between the often literal riffs of early zucker brothers/abrahams films , and the decidedly foul stylings of their post-modern contemporaries , the farrelly brothers . 
as a kind of colorful , dramatized pbs program , frida gets the job done . but , for that , why not watch a documentary ? 
with minimal imagination , you could restage the whole thing in your bathtub . 
believability wasn't one of the film's virtues . 
hollywood ending is the most disappointing woody allen movie ever . he has a great cast and a great idea . but the execution is a flop with the exception of about six gags that really work . 
your appreciation of it will depend on what experiences you bring to it and what associations you choose to make . 
spain's greatest star wattage doesn't overcome the tumult of maudlin tragedy . 
they ought to be a whole lot scarier than they are in this tepid genre offering . 
a pale xerox of other , better crime movies . 
a perfect example of rancid , well-intentioned , but shamelessly manipulative movie making .

if oscar had a category called best bad film you thought was going to be really awful but wasn't , guys would probably be duking it out with the queen of the damned for the honor . 
fessenden has nurtured his metaphors at the expense of his narrative , but he does display an original talent . 
christina ricci comedy about sympathy , hypocrisy and love is a misfire . 
slick piece of cross-promotion . 
it's another video movie photographed like a film , with the bad lighting that's often written off as indie film naturalism . 
the techno tux is good for a few laughs , as are chan and hewitt , but when such a good design turns out to be a cheap knockoff , we can't recommend anything but a rental for the tuxedo . 
the piquant story needs more dramatic meat on its bones . 
it's dumb , but more importantly , it's just not scary . 
i can't recommend it . but it's surprisingly harmless . 
it's of the quality of a lesser harrison ford movie - six days , seven nights , maybe , or that dreadful sabrina remake . 
the experience of going to a film festival is a rewarding one ; the experiencing of sampling one through this movie is not . 
too much of it feels unfocused and underdeveloped . 
i thought my own watch had stopped keeping time as i slogged my way through clockstoppers . 
has a long and clunky ending . . . which forces the audience to fidget through ten pseudo-serious minutes while waiting for the ending credits and the deleted scenes montage to break the audience's awkward silence
uncommonly stylish but equally silly . . . the picture fails to generate much suspense , nor does it ask searching enough questions to justify its pretensions . 
the plot convolutions ultimately add up to nothing more than jerking the audience's chain . 
this is nothing but familiar territory . 
from the opening scenes , it's clear that all about the benjamins is a totally formulaic movie . 
do not see this film . 
i'd have to say the star and director are the big problems here . 
 . . . nothing scary here except for some awful acting and lame special effects . 
doesn't offer much besides glib soullessness , raunchy language and a series of brutal set pieces . . . that raise the bar on stylized screen violence . 
the stripped-down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality , but the measured pace and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious . 
a string of rehashed sight gags based in insipid vulgarity . 
the script isn't very good ; not even someone as gifted as hoffman ( the actor ) can make it work . 
vera's technical prowess ends up selling his film short ; he smoothes over hard truths even as he uncovers them . 
comes . . . uncomfortably close to coasting in the treads of the bicycle thief . 
this piece of channel 5 grade trash is , quite frankly , an insult to the intelligence of the true genre enthusiast . 
an overemphatic , would-be wacky , ultimately tedious sex farce . 
no aspirations to social import inform the movie version . this is a shameless sham , calculated to cash in on the popularity of its stars . 
tambor and clayburgh make an appealing couple  he's understated and sardonic , she's appealingly manic and energetic . both deserve better . 
the affectionate loopiness that once seemed congenital to demme's perspective has a tough time emerging from between the badly dated cutesy-pie mystery scenario and the newfangled hollywood post-production effects . 
for all its technical virtuosity , the film is so mired in juvenile and near-xenophobic pedagogy that it's enough to make one pine for the day when godard can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking . 
it made me want to wrench my eyes out of my head and toss them at the screen . 
instead of hiding pinocchio from critics , miramax should have hidden it from everyone . 
there ought to be a directing license , so that ed burns can have his revoked . 
green might want to hang onto that ski mask , as robbery may be the only way to pay for his next project . 
 . . . routine , harmless diversion and little else . 
a fitfully amusing romp that , if nothing else , will appeal to fans of malcolm in the middle and its pubescent star , frankie muniz . 
the actors are appealing , but elysian fields is idiotic and absurdly sentimental . 
there's no emotional pulse to solaris . with an emotional sterility to match its outer space setting , soderbergh's spectacular swing for the fence yields only a spectacular whiff . 
with virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on , chelsea walls is a triple-espresso endurance challenge . 
though perry and hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by jay scherick and david ronn , neither the actors nor director reginald hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining . 
the story and the friendship proceeds in such a way that you're watching a soap opera rather than a chronicle of the ups and downs that accompany lifelong friendships . 
although huppert's intensity and focus has a raw exhilaration about it , the piano teacher is anything but fun . 
there's not enough here to justify the almost two hours . 
attempts by this ensemble film to impart a message are so heavy-handed that they instead pummel the audience . 
comes off like a rejected abc afterschool special , freshened up by the dunce of a screenwriting 101 class . . . . designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears , " crossroads " instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns . 
schaeffer has to find some hook on which to hang his persistently useless movies , and it might as well be the resuscitation of the middle-aged character . 
this charmless nonsense ensues amid clanging film references that make jay and silent bob's excellent adventure seem understated . 
consists of a plot and jokes done too often by people far more talented than ali g
laughably , irredeemably awful . 
the editing is chaotic , the photography grainy and badly focused , the writing unintentionally hilarious , the direction unfocused , the performances as wooden . 
it may be a prize winner , but teacher is a bomb . 
i'm not suggesting that you actually see it , unless you're the kind of person who has seen every wim wenders film of the '70s . 
to imagine the life of harry potter as a martial arts adventure told by a lobotomized woody allen is to have some idea of the fate that lies in store for moviegoers lured to the mediocrity that is kung pow : enter the fist . 
the piano teacher is the sort of movie that discourages american audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film . 
if it's another regurgitated action movie you're after , there's no better film than half past dead . 
a sermonizing and lifeless paean to teenage dullards . 
the charms of willful eccentricity , at least as evidenced by this latest cinematic essay , are beginning to wear a bit thin . 
nair stuffs the film with dancing , henna , ornamentation , and group song , but her narrative clichés and telegraphed episodes smell of old soap opera . 
it's getting harder and harder to ignore the fact that hollywood isn't laughing with us , folks . it's laughing at us . 
i hated every minute of it . 
not so much funny as aggressively sitcom-cute , it's full of throwaway one-liners , not-quite jokes , and a determined tv amiability that allen personifies . 
the sad thing about knockaround guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film isn't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is . 
plays less like a coming-of-age romance than an infomercial . 
there are a few laughs and clever sight gags scattered about , but not enough to make this anything more than another big-budget bust . 
the story's so preposterous that i didn't believe it for a second , despite the best efforts of everyone involved . 
it is a comedy that's not very funny and an action movie that is not very thrilling ( and an uneasy alliance , at that ) . 
the story is familiar from its many predecessors ; like them , it eventually culminates in the not-exactly -stunning insight that crime doesn't pay . 
 . . . fifty minutes of tedious adolescent melodramatics followed by thirty-five minutes of inflated nonsense . 
when the first few villians are introduced as " spider " and " snake " you know you're in for a real winner , creativity at its peak . 
it's also clear from the start that the transporter is running purely on adrenaline , and once the initial high wears off , the film's shortcomings start to shine through . 
human nature initially succeeds by allowing itself to go crazy , but ultimately fails by spinning out of control . 
the thriller side of this movie is falling flat , as the stalker doesn't do much stalking , and no cop or lawyer grasps the concept of actually investigating the case . 
it tells more than it shows . 
each story on its own could have been expanded and worked into a compelling single feature , but in its current incarnation , storytelling never quite gets over its rather lopsided conception . 
where last time jokes flowed out of cho's life story , which provided an engrossing dramatic through line , here the comedian hides behind obviously constructed routines . 
perfectly enjoyable , instantly forgettable , nothing to write home about . 
sets up a nice concept for its fiftysomething leading ladies , but fails loudly in execution . 
kidman is really the only thing that's worth watching in birthday girl , a film by the stage-trained jez butterworth ( mojo ) that serves as yet another example of the sad decline of british comedies in the post-full monty world . 
taken individually or collectively , the stories never add up to as much as they promise . 
if you're not a prepubescent girl , you'll be laughing at britney spears' movie-starring debut whenever it doesn't have you impatiently squinting at your watch . 
being author wells' great-grandson , you'd think filmmaker simon wells would have more reverence for the material . but this costly dud is a far cry from either the book or the beloved film . 
accuracy and realism are terrific , but if your film becomes boring , and your dialogue isn't smart , then you need to use more poetic license . 
a boring , formulaic mix of serial killers and stalk'n'slash . 
schmaltzy and unfunny , adam sandler's cartoon about hanukkah is numbingly bad , little nicky bad , 10 worst list bad . 
bullock's complete lack of focus and ability quickly derails the film
the truth is that the truth about charlie gets increasingly tiresome . 
rates an 'e' for effort -- and a 'b' for boring . 
you're too conscious of the effort it takes to be this spontaneous . 
a monster combat thriller as impersonal in its relentlessness as the videogame series that inspired it . 
proof that a thriller can be sleekly shot , expertly cast , paced with crisp professionalism . . . and still be a letdown if its twists and turns hold no more surprise than yesterday's weather report . 
in the second half of the film , frei's control loosens in direct proportion to the amount of screen time he gives nachtwey for self-analysis . 
director barry skolnick and his screenwriters glibly tick off every point of " the longest yard " playbook like a checklist . 
one minute , you think you're watching a serious actioner ; the next , it's as though clips from the pink panther strikes again and/or sailor moon have been spliced in . 
john mctiernan's botched remake may be subtler than norman jewison's 1975 ultraviolent futuristic corporate-sports saga . it's also stupider . 
this idea has lost its originality . . . and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture . 
it would be hard to think of a recent movie that has worked this hard to achieve this little fun . 
dawdles and drags when it should pop ; it doesn't even have the virtue of enough mindless violence to break up the tedium of all its generational bonding . 
a great idea becomes a not-great movie . 
life is a crock -- or something like it . 
even as lame horror flicks go , this is lame . 
sunshine state lacks the kind of dynamic that limbo offers , and in some ways is a rather indulgent piece . 
even legends like alfred hitchcock and john huston occasionally directed trifles . . . so it's no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like zhang yimou behind the camera for a yarn that's ultimately rather inconsequential . 
this movie is about lying , cheating , but loving the friends you betray . 
it smacks of purely commercial motivation , with no great love for the original . 
at the bottom rung of the series' entries . 
what kids will discover is a new collectible . what parents will suspect is that they're watching a 76-minute commercial . 
opens at a funeral , ends on the protagonist's death bed and doesn't get much livelier in the three hours in between . 
too simple for its own good . 
the advantage of a postapocalyptic setting is that it can be made on the cheap . any rock pile will do for a set . reign of fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap . 
reggio's trippy , ambitious downer can also sometimes come across like nothing more than a glorified nike ad . 
ben affleck as jack ryan , tom clancy's intrepid hero ? ridiculous . what's next ? d . j . qualls as indiana jones ? or tom green as han solo ? 
the film is directed by wally wolodarsky from a script by joe jarvis and greg coolidge . these are names to remember , in order to avoid them in the future . 
lanie's professional success means she must be a failure at life , because she's driven by ambition and doesn't know how to have fun . 
i can only imagine one thing worse than kevin spacey trying on an irish accent , and that's sultry linda fiorentino doing the same thing . 
sadly , hewitt's forte is leaning forward while wearing low-cut gowns , not making snappy comebacks . 
a hysterical yet humorless disquisition on the thin line between sucking face and literally sucking face . 
director brian levant , who never strays far from his sitcom roots , skates blithely from one implausible situation to another , pausing only to tie up loose ends with more bows than you'll find on a french poodle . 
suggests puns about ingredients and soup and somebody being off their noodle , but let's just say the ingredients don't quite add up to a meal . 
even if you feel like you've seen this movie a thousand times before , it is kind of enjoyable thanks mainly to belushi's easy-going likableness . 
say this for the soundtrack , it drowns out the lousy dialogue . 
if i spy were funny ( enough ) or exciting ( enough ) then it would be fairly simple to forgive the financial extortion it's trying to reap from the moviegoing public . 
places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting , and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller . 
what the four feathers lacks is genuine sweep or feeling or even a character worth caring about . 
this kind of dark comedy requires a delicate , surgical touch . but director danny devito and screenwriter adam resnick ( remember cabin boy ? ) just pound away . 
liman , of swingers and go , makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long , low-heat chase , interrupted by a middling car chase . 
the problem isn't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball . 
a prison comedy that never really busts out of its comfy little cell . 
the smug , oily demeanor that donovan adopts throughout the stupidly named pipe dream is just repulsive . 
this limp gender-bender-baller from a first-time director and rookie screenwriter steals wholesale from that 1982's tootsie , forgetting only to retain a single laugh . 
just because it really happened to you , honey , doesn't mean that it's interesting to anyone else . 
if this movie belonged to a sorority , it would be called beta alpha delta . 
the premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six-packs and a pitcher of margaritas in , but the film must have been written . . . in the thrall of a vicious hangover . 
the film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 minutes . 
you would be better off investing in the worthy emi recording that serves as the soundtrack , or the home video of the 1992 malfitano-domingo production . 
however clever nelson has been in providing variation within the confines of her structure and staging , the question remains whether this should , indeed , have been presented as a theatrical release . 
the impact of the armenian genocide is diluted by too much stage business in the modern day . 
going to the website may be just as fun ( and scary ) as going to the film . 
too timid to bring a sense of closure to an ugly chapter of the twentieth century . 
the only thing that could possibly make them less interesting than they already are is for them to get full montied into a scrappy , jovial team . 
one of those movies where you walk out of the theater not feeling cheated exactly , but feeling pandered to , which , in the end , might be all the more infuriating . 
chaotic , self-indulgent and remarkably ugly to look at , it's . . . like a series of pretentiously awful student films strung together into one feature-length horror .

writer/director john mckay ignites some charming chemistry between kate and jed but , when he veers into sodden melodrama , punctuated by violins , it's disastrous and kate's jealous female friends become downright despicable . 
pryor lite , with half the demons , half the daring , much less talent , many fewer laughs . 
hardly makes the kind of points egoyan wanted to make , nor does it exist as the kind of monument he wanted to build , to victims whose voices have never gained the ears of the world .

the master of disaster - it's a piece of dreck disguised as comedy . 
the film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it isn't exactly kiddie-friendly alas , santa is more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho and the snowman ( who never gets to play that flute ) has all the charm of a meltdown . 
the movie suffers from two fatal ailments -- a dearth of vitality and a story that's shapeless and uninflected . 
will undoubtedly play well in european markets , where mr . besson is a brand name , and in asia , where ms . shu is an institution , but american audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic . 
as aimless as an old pickup skidding completely out of control on a long patch of black ice , the movie makes two hours feel like four .

the film's thoroughly recycled plot and tiresome jokes . . . drag the movie down . 
this story of unrequited love doesn't sustain interest beyond the first half-hour . 
grating and tedious . 
el crimen del padre amaro would likely be most effective if used as a tool to rally anti-catholic protestors . 
there's nothing exactly wrong here , but there's not nearly enough that's right . 
the action here is unusually tame , the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest , and the plot offers few surprises . 
obviously , a lot of people wasted a lot of their time ( including mine ) on something very inconsequential . 
there's a little violence and lots of sex in a bid to hold our attention , but it grows monotonous after a while , as do joan and philip's repetitive arguments , schemes and treachery . 
mostly the film is just hectic and homiletic : two parts exhausting men in black mayhem to one part family values . 
yet another arnold vehicle that fails to make adequate use of his particular talents .

for those for whom the name woody allen was once a guarantee of something fresh , sometimes funny , and usually genuinely worthwhile , hollywood ending is a depressing experience

these guys seem great to knock back a beer with but they're simply not funny performers . 
a grand fart coming from a director beginning to resemble someone's crazy french grandfather . 
though jones and snipes are enthralling , the movie bogs down in rhetoric and cliché . 
a collage of clichés and a dim echo of allusions to other films . 
how many more times will indie filmmakers subject us to boring , self-important stories of how horrible we are to ourselves and each other ?

with the dog days of august upon us , think of this dog of a movie as the cinematic equivalent of high humidity . 
the film is like sitting in a downtown café , overhearing a bunch of typical late-twenty-somethings natter on about nothing , and desperately wishing you could change tables . 
this rather unfocused , all-over-the-map movie would be a lot better if it pared down its plots and characters to a few rather than dozens . . . or if it were subtler . . . or if it had a sense of humor . 
nearly every attempt at humor here is doa . 
if you adored the full monty so resoundingly that you're dying to see the same old thing in a tired old setting , then this should keep you reasonably entertained .

priggish , lethargically paced parable of renewal . 
like being invited to a classy dinner soiree and not knowing anyone . you leave the same way you came -- a few tasty morsels under your belt , but no new friends . 
one of those decades-spanning historical epics that strives to be intimate and socially encompassing but fails to do justice to either effort in three hours of screen time . 
 . . . the picture's cleverness is ironically muted by the very people who are intended to make it shine . 
it has more in common with a fireworks display than a movie , which normally is expected to have characters and a storyline . 
helmer hudlin tries to make a hip comedy , but his dependence on slapstick defeats the possibility of creating a more darkly edged tome . 
every visual joke is milked , every set-up obvious and lengthy , every punchline predictable . there's no energy . 
after the setup , the air leaks out of the movie , flattening its momentum with about an hour to go . 
neither revelatory nor truly edgy--merely crassly flamboyant and comedically labored . 
a preposterous , prurient whodunit . 
an imponderably stilted and self-consciously arty movie . 
the film never rises above a conventional , two dimension tale
mark wahlberg . . . may look classy in a '60s-homage pokepie hat , but as a character he's dry , dry , dry .

the premise of " abandon " holds promise , . . . but its delivery is a complete mess .

if this silly little cartoon can inspire a few kids not to grow up to be greedy bastards , more power to it . 
the movie is too impressed with its own solemn insights to work up much entertainment value . 
the master of disguise may have made a great saturday night live sketch , but a great movie it is not . 
it's a lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character , especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as phoenix's .

a chilly , remote , emotionally distant piece . . . so dull that its tagline should be : 'in space , no one can hear you snore . '
a low-budget affair , tadpole was shot on digital video , and the images often look smeary and blurry , to the point of distraction . then again , in a better movie , you might not have noticed . 
i didn't find much fascination in the swinging . what they're doing is a matter of plumbing arrangements and mind games , of no erotic or sensuous charge . but that they are doing it is thought-provoking . 
a dull , somnambulant exercise in pretension whose pervasive quiet is broken by frequent outbursts of violence and noise . 
it recycles every cliché about gays in what is essentially an extended soap opera . 
more tiring than anything .

apparently , romantic comedy with a fresh point of view just doesn't figure in the present hollywood program . 
epps has neither the charisma nor the natural affability that has made tucker a star . 
a dull , dumb and derivative horror film . 
demme gets a lot of flavor and spice into his charade remake , but he can't disguise that he's spiffing up leftovers that aren't so substantial or fresh .

mildly amusing . 
fairly run-of-the-mill .

everything that was right about blade is wrong in its sequel . 
how much you are moved by the emotional tumult of [françois and michèle's] relationship depends a lot on how interesting and likable you find them .

 " sorority boys " was funnier , and that movie was pretty bad . 
mandel holland's direction is uninspired , and his scripting unsurprising , but the performances by phifer and black are ultimately winning . you'll find yourself wishing that you and they were in another movie . 
a loquacious and dreary piece of business . 
i'm not sure which is worse : the poor acting by the ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by vincent r . nebrida or the gutless direction by laurice guillen . 
while you have to admit it's semi-amusing to watch robert deniro belt out " when you're a jet , you're a jet all the way , " it's equally distasteful to watch him sing the lyrics to " tonight . " 
more of the same old garbage hollywood has been trying to pass off as acceptable teen entertainment for some time now . 
[johnnie to and wai ka fai are] sure to find an enthusiastic audience among american action-adventure buffs , but the film's interests may be too narrow to attract crossover viewers .

amazingly lame . 
 . . . the whole thing succeeded only in making me groggy . 
i'm sorry to say that this should seal the deal - arnold is not , nor will he be , back . 
the idea is more interesting than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of run lola run . 
it's hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby . 
do we really need another film that praises female self-sacrifice ? 
so verbally flatfooted and so emotionally predictable or bland that it plays like the standard made-for-tv movie .

when one hears harry shearer is going to make his debut as a film director , one would hope for the best
check your brain and your secret agent decoder ring at the door because you don't want to think too much about what's going on . the movie does has some entertainment value - how much depends on how well you like chris rock . 
i've never seen ( a remake ) do anything as stomach-turning as the way adam sandler's new movie rapes , pillages and incinerates frank capra's classic . . . 
yet another genre exercise , gangster no . 1 is as generic as its title . 
such a fine idea for a film , and such a stultifying , lifeless execution .

its premise is smart , but the execution is pretty weary . 
if you saw it on tv , you'd probably turn it off , convinced that you had already seen that movie . 
while there's likely very little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the elizabethans ( as well as rank frustration from those in the know about rubbo's dumbed-down tactics ) , much ado about something is an amicable endeavor . 
ultimately , jane learns her place as a girl , softens up and loses some of the intensity that made her an interesting character to begin with . 
hilarious musical comedy though stymied by accents thick as mud . 
davis the performer is plenty fetching enough , but she needs to shake up the mix , and work in something that doesn't feel like a half-baked stand-up routine . 
it has the requisite faux-urban vibe and hotter-two-years-ago rap and r&b names and references . 
attal pushes too hard to make this a comedy or serious drama . he seems to want both , but succeeds in making neither . 
this 90-minute dud could pass for mike tyson's e ! true hollywood story . 
broder's screenplay is shallow , offensive and redundant , with pitifully few real laughs . 
don michael paul uses quick-cuts , ( very ) large shadows and wide-angle shots taken from a distance to hide the liberal use of a body double ( for seagal ) .

despite the opulent lushness of every scene , the characters never seem to match the power of their surroundings . 
disappointing in comparison to other recent war moviesor any other john woo flick for that matter .

all mood and no movie . 
the film never gets over its own investment in conventional arrangements , in terms of love , age , gender , race , and class . 
by the end of it all i sort of loved the people onscreen , even though i could not stand them . perhaps the film should be seen as a conversation starter . it's not an easy one to review . 
totally overwrought , deeply biased , and wholly designed to make you feel guilty about ignoring what the filmmakers clearly believe are the greatest musicians of all time . 
the movie is almost completely lacking in suspense , surprise and consistent emotional conviction . 
a well-acted , but one-note film . 
nearly all the fundamentals you take for granted in most films are mishandled here .

it should be interesting , it should be poignant , it turns out to be affected and boring . 
it has become apparent that the franchise's best years are long past . 
the filmmakers are playing to the big boys in new york and l . a . to that end , they mock the kind of folks they don't understand , ones they figure the power-lunchers don't care to understand , either . 
the big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing .

in terms of execution this movie is careless and unfocused . 
the characters . . . are paper-thin , and their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script . 
spy-vs . -spy action flick with antonio banderas and lucy liu never comes together . 
a preposterously melodramatic paean to gang-member teens in brooklyn circa 1958 . 
the movie isn't painfully bad , something to be 'fully experienced' ; it's just tediously bad , something to be fully forgotten . 
ensemble movies , like soap operas , depend on empathy . if there ain't none , you have a problem . 
a minor-league soccer remake of the longest yard . 
harris is supposed to be the star of the story , but comes across as pretty dull and wooden . 
soulless and -- even more damning -- virtually joyless , xxx achieves near virtuosity in its crapulence . 
a feeble tootsie knockoff . 
a relentless , bombastic and ultimately empty world war ii action flick . 
an inept , tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures , it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more . 
eckstraordinarily lame and severely boring . 
final verdict : you've seen it all before . 
the movie is a little tired ; maybe the original inspiration has run its course . 
the film , like jimmy's routines , could use a few good laughs .

kaufman's script is never especially clever and often is rather pretentious . 
you have once again entered the bizarre realm where director adrian lyne holds sway , where all relationships are simultaneously broadly metaphorical , oddly abstract , and excruciatingly literal . 
the metaphors are provocative , but too often , the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery . 
too much power , not enough puff . 
narc is all menace and atmosphere . 
his [nelson's] screenplay needs some serious re-working to show more of the dilemma , rather than have his characters stage shouting matches about it .
